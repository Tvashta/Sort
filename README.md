# Sorting visualizer

This project sets to visualize various sorting algorithms in the form of a colour spectrum.

## Meet the Algorithms (Implemented So far):

1. Bubble Sort: A naive O(n^2) algorithm which just swaps everytime an inversion is found
2. Selection Sort: Another O(n^2) algorithm which finds the minimum element every time and swaps it with the first element
3. Insertion Sort: An O(n^2) algorithm that maintains a sorted and unsorted array and inserts every element in its place in the sorted array.
4. Heap Sort: O(nlogn) algorithm that maintains a heap and gets the minimum element each time
5. Merge Sort: O(nlogn) Divide and Conquer
6. Quick Sort:
7. Radix Sort:
